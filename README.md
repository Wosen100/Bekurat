About The Project
This app build with the existing knowledge of the React basics, and give you further practice working with codebase linting, component testing, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript. 

The user are two kinds one is the donners and the other will be the beneficiaries.  Beneficiaries as defiend this app are people who be able to add a post, images, edit and update their description and request for funding.  On the other hand donners are people who reads the post and donate monetry support.


This app used Redux Toolkit and state slices to manage any state data needed across multiple components. In the case where data is created and used only within one component (or possibly one and a few of its direct children), consider using useState() or useReducer() and traditional prop drilling. Most apps will use a combination of "local" state management (useState() and useReducer()) and "global" state management (Redux or Context API).

Apply the TypeScript static typing system. try to use TypeScript for the majority of React components! installed typescript, add support for TypeScript linting, and use either .ts or .tsx extension for the files to apply TypeScript type-checking on.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
